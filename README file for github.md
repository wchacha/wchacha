# 👋 Hey there, I’m Winston Ruge Chacha

I’m currently studying Physics with a minor in Math, and I enjoy exploring the intersection between science, hands-on projects, and tech. Whether it's building something with Arduino, analyzing data with Python, or documenting labs in Overleaf, I like learning by doing.

### 🔧 A bit about what I do
- 🛠️ I’ve built an Arduino-powered rover that collects environmental data — it’s helped me apply physics outside the classroom.
- 📊 I use Python (mainly for plotting, basic automation, and data analysis) in my computational physics labs.
- 📄 Most of my lab work is documented in Overleaf (LaTeX), and I’ve gotten comfortable writing technical reports with it.

### 🚀 Some projects I'm working on
- Autonomous Rover (Arduino + sensors)
- Lab documentation & data analysis from spectroscopy labs
- Starting to build a portfolio on GitHub — more coming soon!
